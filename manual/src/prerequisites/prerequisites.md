# Prerequisite Setup

**`nomad` requires a [NerdFont][NerdFont] to correctly display the icons.** Install a NerdFont before installing `nomad`, otherwise you will be very sad when you see what the tree looks like without a NerdFont.

I will provide instructions to install the Hack NerdFont on your system. If you want to use another font, follow the [NerdFont installation guide][NerdFont Installation] for instructions on how to do so for your system.
