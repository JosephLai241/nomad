# Installing a NerdFont on MacOS

Installing a NerdFont on **MacOS** is particularly easy because NerdFonts are available via [Homebrew][Homebrew].

To install the Hack NerdFont, for example, run these commands:

```
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew install --cask font-hack-nerd-font
```

Then go to your terminal's preferences and set the font to the newly installed NerdFont. If you're using [iTerm2][iTerm2], this is located at:

```
iTerm2 -> Preferences -> Profiles tab -> Text tab -> Font dropdown -> Hack Nerd Font Mono
```

[Homebrew]: https://brew.sh/
[iTerm2]: https://iterm2.com/
