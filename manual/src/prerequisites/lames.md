# "I don't want to install a Nerdfont"

If you do not want a crispy looking tree, you can include the `--mute-icons` flag to disable icons.

Including this flag every time you run `nomad` can become cumbersome, so it may be helpful to create an alias for it in your `.bashrc` or equivalent:

```bash
# In `.bashrc`

alias nd="nd --mute-icons"
```

Also, you are lame as **fuck**.
