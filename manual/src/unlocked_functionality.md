# Unlocked Functionality via Labeled Modes

By using a labeled mode, you gain access to the following subcommands:

* [`bat` - `bat` file(s)](./bat.md)
* [`edit` - open file(s) in a text editor](./edit.md)
* `git GIT_SUBCOMMAND` - execute `git` [`add`](./git/add.md), [`blame`](./git/blame.md), [`diff`](./git/diff.md), and [`restore`](./git/restore.md) for file(s)

**All of these subcommands will accept item and/or directory labels.** See their respective sections for more details.
