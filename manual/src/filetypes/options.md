# Listing Filetype Definitions

If you want to see the built-in filetype globs, use the `options` subcommand to see a table containing the filetype and the globs for that particular filetype:

```
nd ft options
```

You can also search for a filetype to only display those matching globs. For example, if you wanted to see the globs for Rust files, you would run:

```
nd ft options rust
```
