# Rootless Mode

Rootless mode is `nomad` in TUI form. You can interactively traverse directories while in this mode, preview files, and even run regex searches within the file.

> **NOTE:** As of v1.0.0, Rootless mode does not support mouse interaction and operates solely on keyboard bindings.

Git status colors are respected in this mode and can also be customized if you do not like the default configuration. See the [Customizing `nomad`](#customizing-nomad) section to learn how to do so.
