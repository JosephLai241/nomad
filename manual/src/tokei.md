# `tokei` - Display Code Statistics

[`Tokei`][tokei] is a code statistics tool written in Rust. This tool displays data such as the number of files, total lines, comments, and blank lines present in your current directory.

`Tokei` is available as its own stand-alone CLI tool, but you can also access its default behavior by using the `tokei` subcommand:

```
nd tokei
```
